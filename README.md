# todos-mobx

Simple `react` APP based on the `create-react-app` stack that manages TODOs. Implemented in order to test some technologies:

* `mobx`: An alternative to `useState`.
* `material-ui`: UI library
* `Context API`: A way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level

This version does not persist data on `localStorage`,.
